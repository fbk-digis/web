At DigiS, research units collaborate across AI and data science, ethics and law, digital humanities, social sciences, education and environmental technologies. 
We combine these perspectives to address real societal needs, working closely with public administrations, communities and organisations on evidence-based, sustainable and human-centred innovation.

Our work spans responsible AI, data governance, civic participation, digital public infrastructures, environmental monitoring, digital education and cultural heritage.

DigiS is organised into research units and support units that work together across disciplines. 
Each unit contributes specific scientific, methodological and technological expertise, collaborating on cross-cutting programmes connected to digital society, responsible AI, environmental intelligence, digital culture and education.

The units operate as an integrated ecosystem, ensuring that research, innovation, policy support and outreach activities align with the mission of DigiS and with FBK’s broader strategic goals.

The Digital Society Center’s research strategy is organized around five interconnected domains that collectively address the complexity of digital transformation. 
These domains, Complex Socio-Technical Systems, Language and Media, AI and Data Literacy, Edge AI, and Remote Sensing, are unified and guided by a central commitment to Digital Ethics. 
This structure ensures that technological innovation is not only advanced and interdisciplinary, but also ethical, trustworthy, and socially responsible.

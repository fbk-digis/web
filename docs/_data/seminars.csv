,Continual Learning in Image Classification and Semantic Segmentation,Enrico Fini,Wednesday 22 September 2021,on-line,"Continual Learning (CL) aims to develop agents emulating the human ability to sequentially learn new tasks while being able to retain knowledge obtained from past experiences. Due to the relevance of its applications, in the last few years, the computer vision research community has put considerable effort into developing CL methods.
After a brief overview of the challenges and the opportunities of CL, we will go through the main families of techniques that are used to mitigate catastrophic forgetting (i.e. the tendency of deep neural networks to forget previously learned information upon learning new information). In addition, we will discuss CL in some interesting applications, as for instance when no information can be transferred between tasks (memory-constrained), and for pixel-wise prediction (semantic segmentation).","Enrico is a Ph.D. student at the University of Trento in the MHUG group, under the supervision of Elisa Ricci. He is currently a visiting researcher in the THOTH team of INRIA (Grenoble, France). His research mainly focuses on continual, self- and semi-supervised learning. Before joining the University of Trento, he was an intern at the European Space Agency (ESA) and Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK). He received his master's degree from Politecnico di Milano and his bachelor's degree from the University of Parma."
,User-centred design in the wild: designing technology for mountain sports,Eleonora Mencarini,Wednesday 06 October 2021,on-line,"Mountain sports are based on the challenge of a natural element like the verticality of rock walls, the deepness of caves, or the unpredictability of snow. Their performance requires physical preparation, psychological and emotional firmness, coordination with partners, and environmental knowledge. In particular, regarding the latter aspect, outdoor sportspeople can offer a new perspective on the territory and its environmental protection. In this seminar, I will present my research on climbing and speleology, highlighting what user-centered design (and the Digis center at large) can do for sportspeople communities and what they can do for us.","Eleonora Mencarini is a researcher at the i3 research unit of FBK. She holds a PhD (cum laude) in Computer Science from the University of Trento (Italy) and an MA (cum laude) in Communication Science from the University of Siena (Italy). Her main research interests are ethnography, co-design, embodied interaction, and interaction design in natural environments. The main application fields where she has conducted her research are outdoor sports, wearable devices, citizen science, playful education."
,Assessing infodemics in complex socio-technical systems,Riccardo Gallotti,Wednesday 20 October 2021,on-line,"An infodemic is the overabundance of (dis)information running across our contact networks because we fail at distinguishing reliable information from unreliable ""fake news"". Thanks to the Covid19 Infodemic Observatory, we are able to capture and process an unprecedented amount of data describing the widespread infodemic associated with the COVID19 pandemic.
In this seminar, I describe how we harness these data to understand the patterns of infodemiological behaviour. I will offer an overview ranging from our earliest results, describing the social mechanics of the infodemics-epidemics interaction at a national level, to our last efforts, focusing on the behaviour of individual by examining not only the communications' informative (or dis-informative) content, but also their intent, measured as the level of hate speech classified with Google's BERT model.","Riccardo is an interdisciplinary physicist working on the data-informed statistical modelling of individual and collective behaviors in the CoMuNe Lab of the Bruno Kessler Foundation. His research focuses on human mobility, decision making, transportation, infodemics, and data science.

,Gamified Education solutions in Software Programming and Modelling: A Tool implementation Perspective,Antonio Bucchiarone,Wednesday 03 November 2021,on-line,"There is a wide interest in adopting gamification solutions for supporting engagement in software modeling and production with learning purposes, e.g., students to actively participate in courses, employees to deal with tedious tasks, or programmers to learn specific languages. Several frameworks to build-up gameful applications have been proposed. Their common goal is raising the level of abstraction of gamification mechanisms and proposing a well-defined set of languages for designing a game, its main components, and the behavioral details.
All the research introduced until now reinforce the idea that there is a strong interest in the use of gamification in modeling and programming. Some early promising results exist, but in general existing attempts are mainly the work of modelers trying to manually create ad hoc gamification environments for their specific experimental scenarios. A real attempt to integrate full gamification in modeling and programming tools is still missing.
Our vision proposes to integrate gamification mechanisms with modeling/programming tools. In this talk I present the required components and the necessary interconnections to adequately assemble altogether and get the resulting gamified modeling/programming tool. Moreover, I present two concrete examples of our idea: I first present an example of a gamified software, Polyglot, conceived to be applied in the field of software programming. After this I introduce PapyGame, a gamified software which finds its application in the field of software modeling. Finally, I illustrate a list of research challenges that must be addressed to realize motivational digital systems able to support personalized learning plansand feedback in context as education and training.","Antonio Bucchiarone is currently a Senior Researcher at the Motivational Digital Systems (MoDiS) research unit. His research activity is focused principally on many aspects of the Software Engineering for Adaptive Socio-Technical Systems. In the last 12 years, he has investigated advanced methodologies and techniques supporting the definition, development, and management of distributed systems that operate in dynamic environments, where being adaptable is a key intrinsic characteristic."
,"Integrating Planning, Acting, and Learning in Unknown Environments",Leonardo Lamanna,Wednesday 17 November 2021,on-line,"An Artificial Intelligence agent should be able to accomplish different tasks in unknown environments. One way to achieve this is by interleaving learning, planning, and acting. In many real scenarios, an agent has to operate in unknown, dynamic and complex environments that it can perceive only through a set of sensors. However, to apply symbolic planning, it requires a symbolic representation of its current state. Therefore an agent has to learn such a symbolic representation by mapping continuous perception variables into high-level discrete ones. Next, given a goal, it can compute a sequence of symbolic actions to achieve the goal. Finally, each symbolic action needs to be compiled down into a sequence of low-level operations executable by the agent actuators.","Leonardo Lamanna graduated in bachelor computer engineering on 13th September 2017 with the final grade of 90/110 at the University of Brescia. His bachelor's Thesis was about applying an optimization metaheuristic to solve a NP-hard problem. Then he graduated in master computer engineering on 11th September 2019 with the final grade of 110/110 cum laude at the University of Brescia. His masterâ€™s Thesis was about integrating Mathematical Programming and Artificial Intelligence techniques to solve integer linear optimization problems.
Currently, he is a Computer Science Ph.D. student of the University of Brescia and the Data and Knowledge Management (DKM) unit of the Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) research center in Trento.

,Human-in-the-Loop for Data Collection: a Multi-Target Counter Narrative Dataset to Fight Online HateSpeech,Helena Bonaldi,Wednesday 01 December 2021,on-line,"Undermining the impact of hateful content with informed and non-aggressive responses, called counter narratives,has emerged as a possible solution for having healthier online communities.Thus, some NLP studies have started addressing the task of counter narrative generation. Although such studies have made an effort to build hate speech /counter narrative (HS/CN) datasets for neural generation, they fall short inreaching either high-quality and/or high-quantity. In this seminar, we presenta novel human-in-the-loop data collection methodology in which a generative language model is refined iteratively by using its own data from the previous loops to generate new training samples that experts review and/or post-edit.Our experiments comprised several loops including diverse dynamic variations.Results show that the methodology is scalable and facilitates diverse, novel,and cost-effective data collection.","Helena Bonaldi is a first year Ph.D.student in the LanD group, under the supervision of Marco Guerini. Her research focuses on dialogical models for counter narrative generation to fight hate speech. Before starting her Ph.D., she was a Data Science student at theUniversity of Trento, and an internship student at Fondazione Bruno Kessler(FBK)."
,Cross-Modal Knowledge Transfer via Inter-Modal Translation and Alignment for Affect Recognition,Vandana Rajan,Wednesday 15 December 2021,on-line,"Multi-modal affect recognition models leverage complementary information in different modalities to outperform their uni-modal counterparts. However, due to the unavailability of modality-specific sensors or data, multi-modal models may not be always employable. For this reason, we aim to improve the performance of uni-modal affect recognition models by transferring knowledge from a better-performing (or stronger)modality to a weaker modality during training. Our proposed multi-modal training framework for cross-modal knowledge transfer relies on two main steps. First, an encoder-classifier model creates task-specific representations for the stronger modality. Then, cross-modal translation generates multi-modal intermediate representations, which are also aligned in the latent space with the stronger modality representations. To exploit the contextual information in temporal sequential affect data, we use Bi-GRU and transformer encoder. We validate our approach on two multi-modal affect datasets, namely CMU-MOSI for binary sentiment classification and RECOLA for dimensional emotion regression. The results show that the proposed approach consistently improves the uni-modal test-time performance of the weaker modalities.","Vandana Rajan received the Master of Technology degree in Digital Signal Processing from the Indian Institute of Space and Technology in 2016 and worked for 2 years as an embedded software engineer. She is currently pursuing her Ph.D degree at the Queen Mary University of London, supervised by Prof. Andrea Cavallaro and Dr. Alessio Brutti. Her research interests mainly include multi-modal signal processing, computational paralinguistics, and speech emotion recognition."
,Digital proximity tracing on empirical networks for pandemic control,Giulia Gencetti and Gabriele Santin,Wednesday 19 January 2022,on-line,"Digital contact tracing is a relevant tool to control infectious disease outbreaks, including the COVID-19 epidemic. Early work evaluating digital contact tracing omitted important features and heterogeneities of real-world contact patterns influencing contagion dynamics. We fill this gap with a modeling framework informed by empirical high-resolution contact data to analyze the impact of digital contact tracing in the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigate how well contact tracing apps, coupled with the quarantine of identified contacts, can mitigate the spread in real environments. We find that restrictive policies are more effective in containing the epidemic but come at the cost of unnecessary large-scale quarantines. Policy evaluation through their efficiency and cost results in optimized solutions which only consider contacts longer than 15â€“20 minutes and closer than 2â€“3 meters to be at risk. Our results show that isolation and tracing can help control re-emerging outbreaks when some conditions are met: (i) a reduction of the reproductive number through masks and physical distance; (ii) a low- delay isolation of infected individuals; (iii) a high compliance. Finally, we observe the ineffi- cacy of a less privacy-preserving tracing involving second order contacts. Our results may inform digital contact tracing efforts currently being implemented across several countries worldwide.","Giulia Cencetti has been a researcher in the MobS group (Mobile and Social Computing Lab) at FBK for more than a year now, where she has been dealing with network science, models of social interactions, urban planning, and other applications to the social sciences of complex systems.

,The Problem of Bias in Hate Speech Detection,Alan Ramponi,Wednesday 2 February 2022,on-line,"Hate speech in online social communities is a serious and pervasive concern, which requires fair and robust automated approaches to be tackled at scale. However, despite the great progress in natural language processing for detecting hate speech, current models have shown to be brittle when applied to real-world data, exhibiting limited out-of-distribution robustness and perpetuating and amplifying harmful social biases. After a brief overview on online hate speech and the multifaceted meaning of ""bias"" in natural language processing, we will dig into the topic, critically analyzing lexical biases in hate speech detection via a cross-platform study and analyzing their impact on out-of-distribution robustness and fairness. We conclude by discussing future avenues for research, arguing that fairness and robustness are strongly intertwined aspects that should be studied jointly in future work.","Alan Ramponi is a postdoctoral researcher in natural language processing (NLP) at Fondazione Bruno Kessler in the Digital Humanities (DH) research group. His research interests include transfer learning, language variation, bias and fairness in NLP. More broadly, he is interested in making NLP robust and more fairly applicable to social sciences problems. Before joining FBK, he was a visiting researcher in the NLPnorth group at the IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark.

,Remote Sensing of Biophysical Parameters in Inland Waters,Milad Niroumand Jadidi,Wednesday 16 February 2022,on-line,"The biophysical attributes of inland waters (e.g., bathymetry and water quality) are closely linked to various aquatic ecosystem services such as drinking water, aquaculture,  and recreation. Satellite remote sensing provides an efficient means of characterizing these parameters across large spatial and temporal extents. This talk will provide an overview of optical remote sensing over water bodies, focusing on physics-based aspects and challenges, e.g., confounding effects from the atmosphere. Then, advanced physical and machine learning-based methods will be addressed for automatically mapping a set of key in-water and benthic parameters. The retrieved parameters include hydro-morphological attributes of fluvial systems such as bathymetry as well as multitemporal dynamics of lake water quality parameters (e.g., chlorophyll-a and total suspended matter).","Milad joined Remote Sensing for Digital Earth (RSDE) unit of FBK as a researcher at the end of 2017. He received a joint Ph.D. degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering from University of Trento, Italy, and Freie UniversitÃ¤t Berlin, Germany, in 2017. His research is focused on retrieving biophysical parameters in inland and coastal waters from optical imagery."

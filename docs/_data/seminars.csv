Remote Sensing of Biophysical Parameters in Inland Waters,Milad Niroumand Jadidi,Wednesday 16 Feb 2022,on-line,"The biophysical attributes of inland waters (e.g., bathymetry and water quality) are closely linked to various aquatic ecosystem services such as drinking water, aquaculture,  and recreation. Satellite remote sensing provides an efficient means of characterizing these parameters across large spatial and temporal extents. This talk will provide an overview of optical remote sensing over water bodies, focusing on physics-based aspects and challenges, e.g., confounding effects from the atmosphere. Then, advanced physical and machine learning-based methods will be addressed for automatically mapping a set of key in-water and benthic parameters. The retrieved parameters include hydro-morphological attributes of fluvial systems such as bathymetry as well as multitemporal dynamics of lake water quality parameters (e.g., chlorophyll-a and total suspended matter).","Milad joined Remote Sensing for Digital Earth (RSDE) unit of FBK as a researcher at the end of 2017. He received a joint Ph.D. degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering from University of Trento, Italy, and Freie Universität Berlin, Germany, in 2017. His research is focused on retrieving biophysical parameters in inland and coastal waters from optical imagery."
The Problem of Bias in Hate Speech Detection,Alan Ramponi,Wednesday 2 Feb 2022,on-line,"Hate speech in online social communities is a serious and pervasive concern, which requires fair and robust automated approaches to be tackled at scale. However, despite the great progress in natural language processing for detecting hate speech, current models have shown to be brittle when applied to real-world data, exhibiting limited out-of-distribution robustness and perpetuating and amplifying harmful social biases. After a brief overview on online hate speech and the multifaceted meaning of ""bias"" in natural language processing, we will dig into the topic, critically analyzing lexical biases in hate speech detection via a cross-platform study and analyzing their impact on out-of-distribution robustness and fairness. We conclude by discussing future avenues for research, arguing that fairness and robustness are strongly intertwined aspects that should be studied jointly in future work.","Alan Ramponi is a postdoctoral researcher in natural language processing (NLP) at Fondazione Bruno Kessler in the Digital Humanities (DH) research group. His research interests include transfer learning, language variation, bias and fairness in NLP. More broadly, he is interested in making NLP robust and more fairly applicable to social sciences problems. Before joining FBK, he was a visiting researcher in the NLPnorth group at the IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark. He earned his Ph.D. and his M.Sc. in computer science from the University of Trento."
Digital proximity tracing on empirical networks for pandemic control,Giulia Gencetti and Gabriele Santin,Wednesday 19 Jan 2022,on-line,"Digital contact tracing is a relevant tool to control infectious disease outbreaks, including the COVID-19 epidemic. Early work evaluating digital contact tracing omitted important features and heterogeneities of real-world contact patterns influencing contagion dynamics. We fill this gap with a modeling framework informed by empirical high-resolution contact data to analyze the impact of digital contact tracing in the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigate how well contact tracing apps, coupled with the quarantine of identified contacts, can mitigate the spread in real environments. We find that restrictive policies are more effective in containing the epidemic but come at the cost of unnecessary large-scale quarantines. Policy evaluation through their efficiency and cost results in optimized solutions which only consider contacts longer than 15–20 minutes and closer than 2–3 meters to be at risk. Our results show that isolation and tracing can help control re-emerging outbreaks when some conditions are met: (i) a reduction of the reproductive number through masks and physical distance; (ii) a low- delay isolation of infected individuals; (iii) a high compliance. Finally, we observe the ineffi- cacy of a less privacy-preserving tracing involving second order contacts. Our results may inform digital contact tracing efforts currently being implemented across several countries worldwide.","Giulia Cencetti has been a researcher in the MobS group (Mobile and Social Computing Lab) at FBK for more than a year now, where she has been dealing with network science, models of social interactions, urban planning, and other applications to the social sciences of complex systems.

Cross-Modal Knowledge Transfer via Inter-Modal Translation and Alignment for Affect Recognition,Vandana Rajan,Wednesday 15 Dec 2021,on-line,"Multi-modal affect recognition models leverage complementary information in different modalities to outperform their uni-modal counterparts. However, due to the unavailability of modality-specific sensors or data, multi-modal models may not be always employable. For this reason, we aim to improve the performance of uni-modal affect recognition models by transferring knowledge from a better-performing (or stronger)modality to a weaker modality during training. Our proposed multi-modal training framework for cross-modal knowledge transfer relies on two main steps. First, an encoder-classifier model creates task-specific representations for the stronger modality. Then, cross-modal translation generates multi-modal intermediate representations, which are also aligned in the latent space with the stronger modality representations. To exploit the contextual information in temporal sequential affect data, we use Bi-GRU and transformer encoder. We validate our approach on two multi-modal affect datasets, namely CMU-MOSI for binary sentiment classification and RECOLA for dimensional emotion regression. The results show that the proposed approach consistently improves the uni-modal test-time performance of the weaker modalities.","Vandana Rajan received the Master of Technology degree in Digital Signal Processing from the Indian Institute of Space and Technology in 2016 and worked for 2 years as an embedded software engineer. She is currently pursuing her Ph.D degree at the Queen Mary University of London, supervised by Prof. Andrea Cavallaro and Dr. Alessio Brutti. Her research interests mainly include multi-modal signal processing, computational paralinguistics, and speech emotion recognition."
Human-in-the-Loop for Data Collection: a Multi-Target Counter Narrative Dataset to Fight Online HateSpeech,Helena Bonaldi,Wednesday 1 Dec 2021,on-line,"Undermining the impact of hateful content with informed and non-aggressive responses, called counter narratives,has emerged as a possible solution for having healthier online communities.Thus, some NLP studies have started addressing the task of counter narrative generation. Although such studies have made an effort to build hate speech /counter narrative (HS/CN) datasets for neural generation, they fall short inreaching either high-quality and/or high-quantity. In this seminar, we presenta novel human-in-the-loop data collection methodology in which a generative language model is refined iteratively by using its own data from the previous loops to generate new training samples that experts review and/or post-edit.Our experiments comprised several loops including diverse dynamic variations.Results show that the methodology is scalable and facilitates diverse, novel,and cost-effective data collection.","Helena Bonaldi is a first year Ph.D.student in the LanD group, under the supervision of Marco Guerini.

"Integrating Planning, Acting, and Learning in Unknown Environments",Leonardo Lamanna,Wednesday 17 Nov 2021,on-line,"An Artificial Intelligence agent should be able to accomplish different tasks in unknown environments. One way to achieve this is by interleaving learning, planning, and acting. In many real scenarios, an agent has to operate in unknown, dynamic and complex environments that it can perceive only through a set of sensors. However, to apply symbolic planning, it requires a symbolic representation of its current state. Therefore an agent has to learn such a symbolic representation by mapping continuous perception variables into high-level discrete ones. Next, given a goal, it can compute a sequence of symbolic actions to achieve the goal. Finally, each symbolic action needs to be compiled down into a sequence of low-level operations executable by the agent actuators.","Leonardo Lamanna graduated in bachelor computer engineering on 13th September 2017 with the final grade of 90/110 at the University of Brescia. His bachelor's Thesis was about applying an optimization metaheuristic to solve a NP-hard problem. Then he graduated in master computer engineering on 11th September 2019 with the final grade of 110/110 cum laude at the University of Brescia. His master’s Thesis was about integrating Mathematical Programming and Artificial Intelligence techniques to solve integer linear optimization problems.
Currently, he is a Computer Science Ph.D. student of the University of Brescia and the Data and Knowledge Management (DKM) unit of the Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) research center in Trento. His Ph.D. topic is the integration of learning, planning and acting in unknown, complex, and dynamic environments."
Gamified Education solutions in Software Programming and Modelling: A Tool implementation Perspective,Antonio Bucchiarone,Wednesday 3 Nov 2021,on-line,"There is a wide interest in adopting gamification solutions for supporting engagement in software modeling and production with learning purposes, e.g., students to actively participate in courses, employees to deal with tedious tasks, or programmers to learn specific languages. Several frameworks to build-up gameful applications have been proposed. Their common goal is raising the level of abstraction of gamification mechanisms and proposing a well-defined set of languages for designing a game, its main components, and the behavioral details.
All the research introduced until now reinforce the idea that there is a strong interest in the use of gamification in modeling and programming. Some early promising results exist, but in general existing attempts are mainly the work of modelers trying to manually create ad hoc gamification environments for their specific experimental scenarios. A real attempt to integrate full gamification in modeling and programming tools is still missing.
Our vision proposes to integrate gamification mechanisms with modeling/programming tools. In this talk I present the required components and the necessary interconnections to adequately assemble altogether and get the resulting gamified modeling/programming tool. Moreover, I present two concrete examples of our idea: I first present an example of a gamified software, Polyglot, conceived to be applied in the field of software programming. After this I introduce PapyGame, a gamified software which finds its application in the field of software modeling. Finally, I illustrate a list of research challenges that must be addressed to realize motivational digital systems able to support personalized learning plansand feedback in context as education and training.","Antonio Bucchiarone is currently a Senior Researcher at the Motivational Digital Systems (MoDiS) research unit. His research activity is focused principally on many aspects of the Software Engineering for Adaptive Socio-Technical Systems. In the last 12 years, he has investigated advanced methodologies and techniques supporting the definition, development, and management of distributed systems that operate in dynamic environments, where being adaptable is a key intrinsic characteristic."
Assessing infodemics in complex socio-technical systems,Riccardo Gallotti,Wednesday 20 Oct 2021,on-line,"An infodemic is the overabundance of (dis)information running across our contact networks because we fail at distinguishing reliable information from unreliable ""fake news"". Thanks to the Covid19 Infodemic Observatory, we are able to capture and process an unprecedented amount of data describing the widespread infodemic associated with the COVID19 pandemic.
In this seminar, I describe how we harness these data to understand the patterns of infodemiological behaviour. I will offer an overview ranging from our earliest results, describing the social mechanics of the infodemics-epidemics interaction at a national level, to our last efforts, focusing on the behaviour of individual by examining not only the communications' informative (or dis-informative) content, but also their intent, measured as the level of hate speech classified with Google's BERT model.","Riccardo is an interdisciplinary physicist working on the data-informed statistical modelling of individual and collective behaviors in the CoMuNe Lab of the Bruno Kessler Foundation.

User-centred design in the wild: designing technology for mountain sports,Eleonora Mencarini,Wednesday 6 Oct 2021,on-line,"Mountain sports are based on the challenge of a natural element like the verticality of rock walls, the deepness of caves, or the unpredictability of snow. Their performance requires physical preparation, psychological and emotional firmness, coordination with partners, and environmental knowledge. In particular, regarding the latter aspect, outdoor sportspeople can offer a new perspective on the territory and its environmental protection. In this seminar, I will present my research on climbing and speleology, highlighting what user-centered design (and the Digis center at large) can do for sportspeople communities and what they can do for us.","Eleonora Mencarini is a researcher at the i3 research unit of FBK.

Continual Learning in Image Classification and Semantic Segmentation,Enrico Fini,Wednesday 22 Sep 2021,on-line,"Continual Learning (CL) aims to develop agents emulating the human ability to sequentially learn new tasks while being able to retain knowledge obtained from past experiences. Due to the relevance of its applications, in the last few years, the computer vision research community has put considerable effort into developing CL methods.
After a brief overview of the challenges and the opportunities of CL, we will go through the main families of techniques that are used to mitigate catastrophic forgetting (i.e. the tendency of deep neural networks to forget previously learned information upon learning new information). In addition, we will discuss CL in some interesting applications, as for instance when no information can be transferred between tasks (memory-constrained), and for pixel-wise prediction (semantic segmentation).","Enrico is a Ph.D. student at the University of Trento in the MHUG group, under the supervision of Elisa Ricci.

Tiny architectures for tiny architectures,Francesco Paissan,Wednesday 2 Mar 2022,on-line,"In the Internet of Things (IoT) era, where we see many interconnected and heterogeneous mobile and fixed smart devices, distributing intelligence from the cloud to the edge has become critical for the sustainability of the infrastructures and comes with additional benefits (e.g. power efficiency, low-latency inference, privacy-by-design) with respect to centralized cloud computing. TinyML is an emerging field that has gained much traction in the last few years. In particular, this paradigm brings novel challenges in the deep learning domain, such as low memory availability and limited energy budget. In this seminar, I will summarize the work done to tackle the challenges of tinyML with novel neural architectures and training paradigms. Our main focus is on multimedia analytics at the edge and privacy-by-design systems. Our efforts landed in state-of-the-art audio and video analytics performance, namely in sound event detection and multi-object detection and tracking with a fraction of the computational complexity of the previous state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we developed a novel approach to generate deep-fakes for privacy-by-design applications directly at the edge.

Emergence of Topological Shortcuts in Machine Learning,Giulia Menichetti,Wednesday 16 Mar 2022,on-line,"In recent years deep learning models have become popular tools to perform link prediction tasks in presence of network structures rich in metadata. Common deep learning frameworks formulate link prediction as a binary classification task, connecting node entities according to their features. The successful training of a binary classifier requires node pairs that are known to bind to each other, as well as negative samples, i.e., pairs that do not interact. Such positive and negative records are usually determined by thresholding continuous variables characterizing the strength of the interaction between two nodes. However, we often observe that link strength is not randomly distributed across the records, but there is correlation between number of annotations and average interaction strength per node. As the annotations commonly follow fat-tailed distributions, the observed correlation drives the hub nodes to have disproportionately more positive links on average, whereas nodes with fewer annotations have more negative examples. Uniformly sampled training datasets affected by this annotation imbalance prompt ML models to learn and predict that some nodes are connected disproportionally more often than others. In other words, ML models learn the connection patterns from the degree of the nodes, neglecting relevant node features. This annotation imbalance offers good performance for the unknown annotations associated with the missing links in the network used for training, a phenomenon we term emergence of topological shortcuts. A key consequence and a signal of such topological shortcuts is the degradation of the performance of an ML model when asked to perform link prediction between novel (i.e., never-before-seen) nodes.
In this talk, I will cover some of the strategies we have developed to control for over-fitting and annotation imbalance, and maximize generalization to unseen nodes.","Dr. Giulia Menichetti is a Senior Research Scientist at the Network Science Institute (Northeastern University), and an Associate Researcher at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (Harvard Medical School).

Orchestration at the Edge: a Key Enabler for 5G and 6G Networks,Rasoul Behravesh,Wednesday 30 Mar 2022,on-line,"The ongoing roll-out of 5G networks paves the way for many fascinating applications such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and autonomous driving. Moreover, 5G enables billions of devices to transfer an unprecedented amount of data at the same time. This transformation calls for novel technologies like multi-access edge computing (MEC) to satisfy the stringent latency and bitrate requirements of these applications. The main challenge pertaining to MEC is that the edge MEC nodes are usually characterized by scarce computational resources compared to the core or cloud, arising the challenge of efficiently utilizing the edge resources while ensuring that the service requirements are satisfied. When considered with the users’ mobility, this poses another challenge, which lies in minimization of the service interruption for the users whose service requests are represented as service function chains (SFCs) composed of virtualized network functions (VNFs) instantiated on the MEC nodes or on the cloud. In this talk, I will present some of the research studies we have conducted to develop SFC placement and VNF lifecycle management strategies at the edge of mobile networks.","Rasoul Behravesh is a researcher in the Smart Networks and Services (SENSE) unit at Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) in Trento, Italy.

Quantifying the robustness of empirical networked complex systems,Oriol Artime Vila,Wednesday 11 May 2022,on-line,"Power grids, trophic relations, online micro-blogging services or scientific collaborations: complex networks are ubiquitous in nature. In the research agenda of network science, network robustness has been a topic of paramount importance due to its conceptual, modelling challenges and its wide range of applications. In this talk I will review some of our latest research on this direction. I will show how to quantify robustness when networked systems are perturbed in two different scenarios. The first one considers metadata defined on the nodes, so metadata-informed attacks are performed in order to understand how to efficiently dismantle (or protect) a network. Thus, we shed light on the importance of non-toological information in network interventions. The second one focuses on the under-researched but empirically relevant phenomenon of non-local cascade spreading. In this, non-local cascading failures evolve on a network in a way that consecutive node failures need not to strictly follow a proximity-based evolution. We propose a mathematically solvable model of such a cascades and evaluate their accuracy in artificial and empirical topologies, finding an excellent agreement.","Oriol Artime Vila is a postdoctoral researcher at CHuB Lab. He holds a PhD in Physics from the Institute for Cross-Disciplinary Physics and Complex Systems (UIB-CSIC, Spain).

Automatic View-Specific Assessment of L2 Spoken English,Stefano Bannò,Wednesday 8 Jun 2022,on-line,"The growing demand for learning English as a second language has increased interest in automatic approaches for assessing and improving spoken language proficiency. A significant challenge in this field is to provide interpretable scores and informative feedback to learners through individual viewpoints of learners’ proficiency, as opposed to holistic scores. Thus far, holistic scoring remains commonly applied in large-scale commercial tests. As a result, an issue with more detailed evaluation is that human graders are generally trained to provide holistic scores.
This talk investigates whether view-specific systems can be trained when only holistic scores are available. To enable this process, view-specific networks are defined where both their inputs and structure are adapted to focus on specific facets of proficiency. It is shown that it is possible to train such systems on holistic scores, such that they provide view-specific scores at evaluation time. View-specific networks are designed in this way for pronunciation, rhythm, text, use of parts of speech and grammatical accuracy.  The relationships between the predictions of each system are investigated on the spoken part of the Linguaskill proficiency test. It is shown that the view-specific predictions are complementary in nature and capture different information about proficiency.","Stefano Bannò is a 3rd year PhD student in Cognitive Science at University of Trento in a joint programme with Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) and is working on a project on automatic assessment of spoken language proficiency.

Neighbourhood matching creates realistic surrogate temporal networks,Antonio Longa,Monday 20 Jun 2022,on-line,"Temporal networks are essential for modeling and understanding systems whose behavior varies in time, from social interactions to biological systems.
Often, however, real-world data are prohibitively expensive to collect or unshareable due to privacy concerns.
A promising solution is 'surrogate networks', synthetic graphs with the properties of real-world networks.
Until now, the generation of realistic surrogate temporal networks has remained an open problem, due to the difficulty of capturing both the temporal and topological properties of the input network, as well as their correlations, in a scalable model.
Here, we propose a novel and simple method for generating surrogate temporal networks.
By decomposing graphs into temporal neighborhoods surrounding each node, we can generate new networks using neighborhoods as building blocks.
Our model vastly outperforms current methods across multiple examples of temporal networks in terms of both topological and dynamical similarity.
We further show that beyond generating realistic interaction patterns, our method is able to capture intrinsic temporal periodicity of temporal networks, all with an execution time lower than competing methods by multiple orders of magnitude.","Antonio is a PhD student at the Fondazione Bruno Kessler and the University of Trento, under the supervision of Bruno Lepri and Andrea Passerini.

Knowledge rules in support of point cloud semantic segmentation,Alessandro Daniele and Eleonora Grilli,Thursday 3 Nov 2022,on-line,"Digital Industry & Digital Society Seminar.

Deep Learning approaches have sparked much interest in the AI community during the last decade, becoming state-of-the-art in domains like pattern recognition, computer vision, and data analysis. In the geospatial and remote sensing field, the availability/unavailability of annotated training data is often a big obstacle, and most of the time, we have to deal with small samples and unbalanced classes. To overcome these problems, we introduce KENN (Knowledge Enhanced Neural Networks) within the 3D semantic segmentation pipeline. KENN is a library that allows neural network models to be modified by providing logical knowledge in the form of a set of logic constraints.
To give a practical example, in a point cloud semantic segmentation challenge, the rule which states that ""poles""cannot be over a ""building"" is employed by KENN to avoid misclassification problems with antennas.
The work presented is the result of a collaboration between the 3D Optical Metrology unit and the Data Knowledge and Management (DKM) Unit.","Alessandro Daniele received his master's degree in Computer Science at Università degli Studi di Padova and his Ph.D. at Università degli Studi di Firenze.

Un approccio etico alla società digitale,Franco Manti,Monday 7 Nov 2022,Fondazione Bruno Kessler e on-line,"Le ICT, attraverso le quali si originano nuovi ambienti, hanno portato al superamento della tradizionale contrapposizione fra realtà, possibilità, potenzialità poiché in essi ciò che è possibile si è già realizzato e ciò che sembra essere solo potenziale ha in sé il potere di farsi reale. Perciò, realtà virtuale non è più un ossimoro, ma definisce un diverso livello ontologico rispetto a quello del mondo fisico in cui viviamo nella nostra quotidianità. Questo comporta una forte ricaduta sulle nostre relazioni, ne genera nuove, influisce sulla qualità delle nostre vite e sulla nostra stessa autonomia nel dare (a noi e agli altri) ragione di scelte e comportamenti. Partendo da queste considerazioni, il seminario affronta il problema di definire un approccio etico per la nuova società digitale che si sta imponendo.
Le questioni morali e le prospettive etiche poste dalle relazioni con e nello spazio virtuale ci pongono due quesiti: le realtà virtuali, aumentate, ecc. sono di per sé virtuose? L’approccio con ambienti nei quali reale, potenziale, possibili sono unificati richiede, ancora, la necessità di una distinzione fra i diversi livelli ontologici?
La ridefinizione del rapporto ambiente - comunicazione comporta implicazioni rilevanti sul piano dell’etica pubblica e dell’esercizio della cittadinanza. Alcuni si preoccupano dell'influenza delle piattaforme online sulla democrazia, altri sottolineano il loro potenziale come nuovi forum pubblici accessibili. La domanda cui rispondere è: in che modo le tecnologie dell'informazione possono sostenere o migliorare la cittadinanza, la partecipazione politica e i comportamenti virtuosi senza cadere nell’utopia (pericolosa) della nuova agorà telematica?","Laureato in Filosofia, insegna Etica Sociale, Etica della Comunicazione, Comunicazione Etico- sociale d’Impresa, Filosofia Morale presso la Scuola di Scienze Sociali - Dipartimento di Scienze della Formazione e presso la Scuola di Scienze Mediche e Farmaceutiche - Dipartimento di Scienze della Salute dell’Università di Genova.

Globally scaled detection of burned areas with remote sensing,Massimo Zanetti,Wednesday 30 Nov 2022,Fondazione Bruno Kessler and on-line,"Global scale assessment of the fraction of vegetated land affected by fires, i.e., burned area (BA), is essential for climate related studies, and open-access satellite-borne multi-spectral imagery represents an invaluable source of information for the mapping purpose.

Characterization of BAs through spectral analysis is complex and several factors such as vegetation type, localeco-climate systems, seasonal cycles and temporal attenuation need to be taken into account, leading to the practical impossibility of representing the BA spectral signature as an invariant property at global level and forcing classification algorithms to be extremely dependent on local models that are difficult to train and on a variety of ancillary data that are usually not available at large scales.

In a recent study, these aspects are investigated by focusing the analysis to multi-spectral derived features known as normalized difference indexs (NDIs), a family of band-algebra transofrmations producing variables with known established correlations tophisically-related post-fire effects on vegetation, and a novel classification framework is presented which is aimed at reducing the locality of the BA multi-spectral signature representation while enabling for an improved globally extended general characterization. The effectiveness of the proposed approachis demonstated in a global scale BA detection simulation validated against recently published BA reference global data.","Massimo Zanetti is a researcher in the Remote Sensing for Digital Earth (RSDE) unit at the Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) in Trento, Italy.

His background is on mathematical methods for image analysis and numerical optimization. His reasearch is focused on remote sensing problems such as multi-spectral image analysis and change detection models. The rationale behind his work is to develop models and systems to automatically extract valuable information from last generation EarthObservation (EO) satellite-borne imagery data, with focus on climate change related problems."
"Public Administration and Data (Re)use: Dataspaces, Collective Rationality, and their Limits",Riccardo Nanni,Tuesday 13 Dec 2022,Fondazione Bruno Kessler and on-line,"In this seminar we assess public administrations’ obstacles and best practices in data exposure and reuse. We employee three research methods: “problematisation as a method”, expert interviews, and focus groups. This research contributes to the literature on rationality in decision-making, observing the extent to which data-driven policymaking expands the boundaries of bounded rationality through collective rationality. Concretely, we find that smaller public administrations often lack competences to keep track of existing data within the organisation itself and to make use of it in decision-making. This entails that participation in dataspaces and the use of data in decision-making is more applicable to bigger-size organisations. Therefore, while pooling data in dataspaces expands the boundaries of bounded rationality through collective rationality, limits remain due to the underrepresentation of smaller institutional actors and their data. We propose measures to make dataspaces scalable and facilitate access to them for a wider variety of actors.","Riccardo Nanni is researcher in data governance at the Digital Commons Lab of Fondazione Bruno Kessler. His background is in international relations, with a PhD obtained in June 2022 at the University of Bologna.

Maximising reachability via walk temporalisation,Filippo Brunelli,Tuesday 10 Jan 2023,Fondazione Bruno Kessler ,"In a temporal graph, each edge appears and can be traversed at specific points in time. In such a graph, temporal reachability of one node from another is naturally captured by the existence of a temporal path where edges appear in chronological order. Inspired by the optimisation of bus/metro/tramway schedules in a public transport network, we consider the problem of turning a collection of walks (called trips) in a directed graph into a temporal graph by assigning a starting time to each trip so as to maximise the reachability among pairs of nodes. Each trip represents the trajectory of a vehicle and its edges must be scheduled one right after another. Setting a starting time to the trip thus forces the appearing time of all its edges. We call such a starting time assignment a trip temporalisation. We obtain several results about the complexity of maximising reachability via trip temporalisation. Among them, we show that maximising reachability via trip temporalisation is hard to approximate within a factor $\sqrt{n}/12$ in an $n$-vertex digraph, even if we assume that for each pair of nodes, there exists a trip temporalisation connecting them. On the positive side, we show that there must exist a trip temporalisation connecting a constant fraction of all pairs if we additionally assume symmetry, that is, when the collection of trips to be scheduled is such that, for each trip, there is a symmetric trip visiting the same nodes in reverse order.","Filippo Brunelli received his Master degree in mathematics from the University of Pisa in 2019. He is currently a third year PhD student enrolled at Inria Paris and hosted at IRIF (Insitut de Recherche en Informatique Fondamentale) laboratory in Paris, under the supervision of Laurent Viennot and Pierluigi Crescenzi.

The ESA JUICE mission and sub-surface sounding of the Galilean Icy Moons,Elena Donini,Friday 5 May 2023,Fondazione Bruno Kessler and on-line,"JUpiter Icy moon Explorer (JUICE) mission is the first large European mission to the Jovian system and has onboard ten scientific experiments. JUICE aims to explain how the Solar system works and identify the conditions for planet formation and the emergence of life. FBK is involved in developing the radar sounder instrument, Radar for Icy Moon Exploration (RIME), that images the subsurface by generating radargrams. Radargrams store surface and subsurface geology information, including the possible presence of shallow water pockets on the Icy Moons. The analysis of RIME radargrams acquired on the Galileian Moons will unveil unique surface and subsurface geology information and help better understand the evolution of the Jovian and the solar systems. During the seminar, we will illustrate the JUICE mission focusing on the RIME instrument and the methods for the automatic analysis of radargrams.",Elena Donini is a researcher at the RSDE research unit of FBK. She holds a Ph.D. (cum laude) in Information and Communication Technologies from the University of Trento (Italy) and a master in degree (cum laude) in Telecommunications Engineering from the University of Trento(Italy). Her main research interests are related to the automatic analysis of radar sounder data for Earth observation and planetary exploration.
Charting AI Urbanism,Otello Palmini,Thursday 6 Jun 2024,Fondazione Bruno Kessler,"The aim of this communication is to tease out some of the key issues concerning the relationship between AI and urbanism. This relationship, which is presented in the academic literature as a new driving force of contemporary urbanism, will be investigated through an interdisciplinary approach that places urban studies and philosophy of technology in dialogue. AI urbanism will be inquired through key turning points in the history of the relationship between technology and the city, namely Modern Urbanism, Cybernetics and the Smart City paradigm. The analysis of these three conceptual sources will provide some insights into AI urbanism, both in terms of criticalities and opportunities. Finally, cybernetics as a model for non-deterministic use of the digital twin will be highlighted.","Bachelor and Master Degree in Philosophy at the University Of Bologna and currently PhD student in Architecture and Urban Planning (IDAUP) at the University of Ferrara.
